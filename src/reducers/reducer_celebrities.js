    name: 'Kim Kardashian',
    Age: 37,
    birthday: 'October 21, 1980',
    plife: `As a reality television star, Kardashian's love life has been the subject of intense media interest. She was only 20 years old when she wed music producer Damon Thomas in 2000. The marriage ended after four years. Following her divorce, Kardashian had a string of high profile boyfriends, including singer Nick Lachey and New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush.
    
    In 2010, Kardashian had a whirlwind courtship with pro basketball player Kris Humphries. The pair married in a lavish, televised ceremony the following August in front of more than 400 guests. But wedded bliss would be short-lived for Kardashian and Humphries. Kardashian filed for divorce after only 72 days of marriage. Humphries sought an annulment instead and claimed that the marriage was a fraud. In April 2013, it was announced that Kardashian and Humphries had settled their divorce, avoiding a long-awaited trial that had been scheduled to take place in May 2013.
    
    While her divorce proceedings were dragging on, however, in early 2012, Kardashian became involved with famed rapper Kanye West. In December 2012, the couple revealed that they were expecting their first child together. Kardashian posted on her blog, "It's true!! Kanye and I are expecting a baby. We feel so blessed and lucky." She and West welcomed a daughter on June 15, 2013, in Los Angeles, California. A few days after the child's birth, it was revealed that the couple had decided to name their daughter North and call her "Nori."
    
    On October 21, 2013, Kardashian and West got engaged on her 33rd birthday. West proposed to her at the AT&T baseball stadium in San Francisco, which he rented out for the occasion. The couple tied the knot the following May. They held their rehearsal dinner at a famed French landmark Versailles. The ceremony itself was held on May 24, 2014, in Forte di Belvedere, a historic fortress, in Florence, Italy. Her stepfather, Bruce Jenner, walked her down the aisle as famed vocalist Andrea Bocelli sang "Con te Partiro." In addition to her family, Kardashian and West were joined by such celebrities as director Steven McQueen and actor Jaden Smith on their special day.
    
    In the 10th season of her reality series, Kardashian documented her desire to get pregnant again and her struggles with fertility issues. In May 2015, she revealed in a teaser for her show that she was pregnant with her and West's second child. The couple welcomed their son, Saint West, on December 5, 2015.
    
    The following year Kardashian experienced various personal setbacks that would cause her to step out of the spotlight. While in France attending Paris Fashion Week, the reality star was the victim of an armed robbery. On October 3, 2016 at 2:19 a.m., a group of robbers broke into the Hotel de Pourtales, a luxury apartment building where Kardashian was staying, and forced the night receptionist to open the door to her penthouse, according to an article in Vanity Fair. Kardashian’s wrists and ankles were bound and her mouth was taped shut while the thieves stole a 20-carat diamond ring and a jewelry box worth an estimated $5.6 million. Kardashian was not physically harmed, but was reportedly traumatized by the crime, which was being investigated by Paris’ crime unit La Brigade de Répression du Banditisme. Following the crime, the very public star stopped posting on social media and avoided public appearances, opting to take time off to recover. 
    
    A month later, Kardashian’s husband Kanye West cancelled his concert tour and was hospitalized on November 21, 2016 and treated for exhaustion at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. Kardashian was expected to make her first public appearance since the Paris robbery at an event in New York City, however, she cancelled to be with West at the hospital. He was released from the hospital on November 30, just days before their son's first birthday.
    
    The following year, it was announced that the power couple had sold their Bel-Air mansion for a whopping $17.8 million, nearly $8 million more than the price they had paid in 2013. The sale came after years of renovations on a new estate in Hidden Hills, California. 
    
    Around that same time, Kardashian celebrated the pending arrival of child No. 3 with her hubby by throwing a lavish cherry-blossom themed baby shower. She also revealed to the public that the newcomer was a girl, as well as the emotional difficulties of having to turn to a surrogate due to health issues. “You know, it is really different,” she told Entertainment Tonight. “Anyone that says or thinks it is just the easy way out is just completely wrong. I think it is so much harder to go through it this way, because you are not really in control.”
    
    “Obviously you pick someone that you completely trust and that you have a good bond and relationship with, but it is still … knowing that I was able to carry my first two babies and not my baby now, it’s hard for me," she said. `,
